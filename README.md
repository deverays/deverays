# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a 15-year-old web developer from the Czech Republic, who loves open source.
I mainly code in Python and JavaScript, but I am always learning. I am currently
working on a couple of open-source projects, including my own
[Interclip](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip), which is a tool
that can be used to share links across devices. I also just started contributing
to [Open Sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced), which is a site to
manage your future open-source contributions.
